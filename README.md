Complete Git and GitHub 
Git and GitHub are two related but distinct concepts:

**Git**:

* A local version control system that runs on a developer's machine.
* Helps manage code and track changes locally.
* Allows developers to create a local repository to store and manage their code.

**GitHub**:

* A web-based platform that provides a remote repository for storing and managing code.
* A website that allows developers to store and share their Git repositories online.
* Provides a collaborative platform for developers to work together on projects, track changes, and manage different versions of their code.

In summary, Git is a local tool for managing code, while GitHub is a web-based platform for storing and sharing Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and version control.
