Complete Git and GitHub 
Git and GitHub are two related but distinct concepts:

**Git**:

* A local version control system that runs on a developer's machine.
* Helps manage code and track changes locally.
* Allows developers to create a local repository to store and manage their code.

**GitHub**:

* A web-based platform that provides a remote repository for storing and managing code.
* A website that allows developers to store and share their Git repositories online.
* Provides a collaborative platform for developers to work together on projects, track changes, and manage different versions of their code.

In summary, Git is a local tool for managing code, while GitHub is a web-based platform for storing and sharing Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and version control.

**How to Config git**


1. Set up your username and email address:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
2. Configure your Git settings:
```
git config -l
```
This will list all your Git settings.

3. Set up your default editor:
```
git config --global core.editor "your_editor"
```
Replace "your_editor" with your preferred editor, such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.

4. Check your Git configuration:
```
git config -l
```
This will display your current Git configuration settings.

Additionally, the tutorial mentions setting up your Git configuration at a global level using the `--global` flag, and at a local level using the `--local` flag.

For example, to set up your username and email address at a global level:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
And to set up your username and email address at a local level (for a specific repository):
```
git config --local user.name "Your Name"
git config --local user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
It's also important to note that you can configure Git using a Git configuration file, usually located at `~/.gitconfig` on Linux and macOS, or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.gitconfig` on Windows. </br> </br> </br> 
**Here are the explanations for "clone" and "status" in the context of Git**:

**Clone:**
The `clone` command is used to create a local copy of a remote Git repository. It allows you to download a project from GitHub or another Git repository to your local machine. When you clone a repository, you are essentially creating a duplicate of the original project, which you can then modify and work on locally.

**Status:**
The `status` command is used to check the status of your local Git repository. It shows you the current state of your project, including any changes you've made, files that are staged or unstaged, and any conflicts or issues that need to be resolved. The `status` command helps you keep track of your changes and ensures that you're aware of any modifications that need to be committed or pushed to the remote repository.

In summary, `clone` is used to download a remote repository to your local machine, while `status` is used to check the current state of your local repository.
